### The Roots of FreeFroots

The idea for FreeFroots was born out of the success and shift of **DiRoots**, a once-popular plugin that went **freemium**. While DiRoots did wonders for automating tasks, the transition to a paid model left many professionals seeking an alternative. Drawing inspiration from DiRoots’ success, **FreeFroots** aims to offer the same tried-and-tested tools *free of charge*, providing a solid base for automation in AEC industries. 

But we don’t just stop there—FreeFroots is also a *testing ground* for new ideas and features. This allows contributors to experiment and add new functionalities while giving *newbie contributors* the chance to grow and learn through real-world projects. It's a space for everyone—from seasoned pros to those just starting to branch out into open-source development.
